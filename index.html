        <p id="book">my hobby is reading because in reading you learn lot's of things like new words,having a imagination ,and more. when you like a book you wnat to read more of that book so i am a 10 years old boy that i like to read graphic novels. so it makes me like more books like chapter books which i read and they are fun to read.reading is not only for hobbys it is for life like right now if i haven't been reading then i would not be doing this right now. so if you do not read can you please read it is for your own good!</p>
